## 🧠 Why Is This Public?
This repository is made public to share progress transparently, seek industry-level collaboration, and prove a working alternative to LLM memory degradation — not to offer source code for reuse.

If you’re here for curiosity, great — explore the docs, follow the repo, or open a respectful discussion.
