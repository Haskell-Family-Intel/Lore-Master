# LorM: Lore Master – Structured Memory for Creative Intelligence

*Developed by Haskell Family Intel*

---

## 🧠 What Is LorM?
**LorM (Lore Master)** is a modular memory system designed to bring persistent, structured, and accurate recall to AI-enhanced storytelling.

It allows writers, worldbuilders, and LLM systems to maintain detailed continuity across massive narrative arcs — even beyond single sessions or token limits.

### Built For:
- 📚 Authors crafting complex story worlds
- 🎮 Game studios managing interactive lore bibles
- 🎥 Screenwriters tracking evolving timelines
- 🤖 LLM tool developers enhancing prompt consistency

---

## 🧬 What Makes LorM Unique?
Unlike traditional RAG systems, LorM emulates **human memory behavior**, with:

| Human Cognition       | LorM Equivalent                          |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Hippocampus (STM)     | In-memory recall + current session cache |
| Long-Term Memory      | archive with indexed schemas|
| Prefrontal Cortex     | rule engine for active context |
| Memory Consolidation  | cross-validation and update logic |
| Compression Heuristics| shorthand + hybrid storage |

It’s not just memory. It’s cognitive architecture.

## ✍️ How LorM Was Born
> *“I was just trying to keep my characters straight in a crossover fanfic.”*

LorM began as a necessity — a handcrafted memory scaffold for a crossover space opera where LLMs (Grok and ChatGPT) kept forgetting plot threads.

After manually building a shorthand memory system with persistent recall and compression, the author realized:  
🔁 *This wasn’t just for fiction. This was the missing layer in AI story reasoning.*

What began as a fanfiction patch became a full-fledged, narrative-aware memory framework — capable of reconstructing complex stories across time and models.

## 🚫 This Is Not Open Source
LorM is proprietary IP. It may not be:
- Forked
- Used for model training
- Republished
- Integrated into LLM infrastructure without a **paid license**

See [LICENSE.md](./LICENSE.md) for full legal terms.

## 💡 Why It Matters
Modern LLMs forget. They overwrite. They hallucinate.  
**But LorM remembers.**

You can:
- Feed a prompt with compressed backstory
- Maintain continuity across months of drafting
- Integrate structured narrative cards into any LLM-based tool

The result? An AI that *understands your world*, *remembers your characters*, and *builds on your lore* like a trusted co-author.
