# LorM Creator License v1.0
*Developed by Haskell Family Intel*

### 🔒 TL;DR: What You Can Do

✅ **Use LorM for personal or non-commercial creative projects** (books, games, scripts, etc.) under the terms of a user license  
✅ **Request commercial or extended access** through the licensing contact below  
✅ **Use it to enhance AI prompts or memory** — with attribution and without model training

---

### ❌ What You May NOT Do

🚫 **Use LorM or its components to train or fine-tune AI models** (LLMs, diffusion, audio, or otherwise)  
🚫 **Fork, redistribute, or make public copies of LorM or its components**  
🚫 **Incorporate LorM into closed-source or commercial tools** without a license agreement  
🚫 **Sell, resell, or sublicense** the LorM system, structure, or schemas without express written permission  
🚫 **Strip out copyright notices, author tags, or HFI branding** — doing so is legal grounds for enforcement  
🚫 **Use LorM-derived works in ways that violate applicable law**, including defamation, fraud, or misleading use of attribution

---

### 🧠 Protected Scope
This license specifically applies to:
- The **Lore Card architecture** (e.g., summaries, arcs, segments, recall maps)
- The **AiQ-style compression and shorthand schema** for narrative data
- The **AiRS-style rule system** for structured recall, injection, and rotation
- The **LorM flow logic** (e.g., card > compression > feed > recall)
- All included or future `.json`, '.py', `.md`, or `.txt` schemas released under this system

These formats are protected whether expressed directly or derived via template, function, or file structure.

---

### 📜 Legal Terms

**Attribution Required**: All authorized uses, case studies, or publications must credit "Haskell Family Intel - LorM" in a clearly visible and discoverable way.

**License Tiers**: Users must acquire a license appropriate to:
- The scale of their project
- The scope of their use
- The specific components utilized
- Whether the Work has been used to influence, supplement, or inform internal tools, products, or training systems

**No Liability**: Haskell Family Intel assumes **no liability** for how LorM is used — even if it becomes part of a creative work, legal proceeding, or generative AI workflow.

**Legal Enforcement**: We reserve the right to:
- Pursue legal action against those who strip attribution, branding, or format structure from LorM
- Seek recoupment of legal costs and damages in **any legal matter involving unauthorized or non-attributed use**, regardless of case outcome
- Require take-downs of unauthorized forks, reproductions, or derivative works violating these terms

**AI Model Use Clause**: Use of LorM or its file structures to inform, train, fine-tune, or augment **proprietary AI models** (e.g., LLMs) — including but not limited to OpenAI, xAI, Google DeepMind, Meta, Anthropic — is strictly prohibited without commercial license agreement.

---

### 💰 Commercial and Paywalled Access
Due to the unique capabilities and commercial potential of the LorM system, access to:
- Advanced templates
- AiQ card packs
- In-depth lore compression workflows
- Developer-tier utilities and import/export tools

...is restricted to **licensed users** under a **paid tier model.**

A public demo or limited preview may be offered, but continued use for any professional, studio, or resale-adjacent use case **requires a signed license agreement.**

---

### 🚫 Not Open Source
LorM is a proprietary creative system, built for precision narrative memory. While it welcomes collaboration, it is not open source.

**Unauthorized redistribution or publication is a violation of this license.**
